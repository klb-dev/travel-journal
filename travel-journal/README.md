# ABOUT
My first React project. A simple use of props from an internal database. In order to be able to deploy it I must use npm build. It is simple, because the learning is in stages of how to develop with React. This uses a data base that is set within the code itself. Props is the learning process and being able to get information without hardcoding. I

# LEARNING
The React part seems to be straight forward with the use of JSX and JavaScript. The way things are set up are straight forward. This is just the being of my React learning, where I have been developing most of the information with props.

I have had to learn some part of Vite in order to develop it and make it seen on Netlify. This has been the most confusing process. Vite makes me use the public folder in order for pictures to be seen, although I have struggled with some images. Even though I am using a database within the project 2 of the images show the alt text. I am no sure if it is just my local. 

For a first time project it has had it's ups and downs. I will keep learning and being able to set up my sites for production. Keeping at it.

# UP NEXT
Making it up to date React. I have not fully learned the new React as teaching is from previous versions. I will implement React 18.

I would like to create this into actual blog or travel journal of my experiences. Not just Europe but around the world. Adding what I actually did instead of just landmarks visited.
